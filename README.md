BISH BOSH
Bish-bosh function. For a range of numbers: if the number in the range is evenly divisible by either of two numbers (bish or bosh) output is change. Else it remains the same.
For example the number 12, bish = 3, evenly divisible (12%3 => 0) output is changed to "bish" rather than 12.
Implemented:
1. A default version runs in the console (F12/inspect) of the browser.
2. A form with custom input for the range and bish/bosh values runs on the webpage and outputs at the bottom of the webpage.
